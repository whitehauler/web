                <h3>How I started learning programming ?</h3>
                <p>Now I was in 9th standard, I had completed my vacation's assignmentss so early and I was free most of the times. One time I went to my frineds home and her brother has completed a course from a respectable university and he know that I am interested in Comouter Science. So he had told me about C programming language and gave me some lectures of that. In my free time I started learning from those lectures and I was able to make "Hello World!" program.</p>

                <h3>When I joined Sololearn !!!</h3>
                <p>Someone had told me about this app or I knew it from a YouTube channel , i had not remember. But at that time Sololearn has diffrent apps for different courses , these apps are still present in play store . I had installed learn C but soon I had uninstalled it and installed learn HTML. I learned some basics of HTML from books and rest of the things which i knew about web developments and other things are from Sololearn Community. But after sometimes , I had uninstalled it again.</p>

                <h3>How I started to be in SL Community ???</h3>
                <p>In this time , I had enough knowledge to be interested in Computer Science and Programming. I was having free times again , and I thought to install Sololearn and after seeing a new unified app I could not stop myself from exploring it. After installing , I got to know new languages and features of SL and started to be active daily. At earlier , I was focused on learning and less interested to play challenges and i played only with them who was junior ( less level ) than me , but after observing so much and full learning , i interested to play with highier level proflies ( at that time , there was not so many users with high level ) .</p>
